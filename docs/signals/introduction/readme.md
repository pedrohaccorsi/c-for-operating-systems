## What are signals

Signals are Software interruptions that happen due to either Software pre-definition or hardware exceptions. For example, it could happen in divisions by zero, or unauthorized attempt of memory access. In general, we can understand signals as way to send information from the OS to our user processes.

## Examples of signals 

Signals will start with the prefix `SIG` , and will have specific use cases. Below is a list with the most common ones:

| signal          | value | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Visual representation

As show below, the signal comes from outside the process. It will stop the current flow of the process so that it can be handled, and then it will go back to where it was before the signal.
